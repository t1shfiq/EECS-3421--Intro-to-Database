# EECS-3421--Intro-to-Database

Both files are affiliated with the assignments I had to do during my 'Introduction to databases' course.

Inside 'E-R MODEL & Postgres.pdf,' I had to draw a Entity-Relationship diagram and write the DDL associated with it.

For the other one, I had to write queries in relational algebra format.
